	<ol>
		<li>
			<h5>Image Recognition</h5>
			<p class="justificado">
				This tool is able to detect both brain tumours and pneumonia.

				The main function is to give a quick response to the given image in order to be of help to the medical
				staff.

				That is why our goal is efficiency at the moment of giving the result.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>Extract CDS</h5>
			<p class="justificado">
				This tool is able to give a quick response by passing it a genbank from which it will extract the CDS
				inside.

				That is why our goal is efficiency at the moment of giving the result.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>Genbank to Fasta</h5>
			<p class="justificado">
				This tool is able to give a quick response by passing it a genbank from which it will extract the Fasta
				inside.

				That is why our goal is efficiency at the moment of giving the result.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>DNA to Protein</h5>
			<p class="justificado">
				This tool is able to give a quick response by passing a fasta file with DNA in it which will be
				converted to protein.

				That is why our goal is efficiency at the moment of giving the result.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>DNA to RNA</h5>
			<p class="justificado">
				This tool is able to give a quick response by passing a fasta file with DNA inside which will be
				converted to RNA.

				That is why our goal is efficiency at the moment of giving the result.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>Complementary Sequence</h5>
			<p class="justificado">
				This tool is able to give a quick answer by providing a fasta file with DNA from which it will draw the
				respective complementary strand.

				That is why our goal is efficiency at the moment of giving the result.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>Split Fasta</h5>
			<p class="justificado">
				This tool is able to give a quick response by passing a fasta file with DNA and two numbers which will
				be the start of the cut and the end of the cut to be made in the chain.

				That is why our goal is efficiency at the moment of giving the result.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>Global Alignment</h5>
			<p class="justificado">
				This tool is able to give a quick response by passing two files in fasta format and is able to align them globally.

				That is why our goal is efficiency at the moment of giving the result.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>Local Alignment</h5>
			<p class="justificado">
				This tool is able to give a quick response by passing two files in fasta format and is able to align them locally.

				That is why our goal is efficiency at the moment of giving the result.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>Reverse Complementary</h5>
			<p class="justificado">
				This tool is able to give a quick response by passing a fasta file with DNA from which it will draw the
				respective reverse complementary strand.

				That is why our goal is efficiency at the moment of giving the result.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>Random Sequence</h5>
			<p class="justificado">
				This tool is able to give a quick answer by passing a number which is the number of bases you want to
				have in the chain.

				That is why our goal is efficiency at the moment of giving the result.
