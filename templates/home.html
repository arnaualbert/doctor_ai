                        <h3>Image Recognition</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>Input:</strong> The tool provides an
									input field where users can upload an image
									file containing an X-ray picture of the
									lungs. Users can either browse their local
									file system or drag and drop the image file
									into the input field.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>Submit:</strong> Once the user has
									selected the image file, they click the
									"Submit" button to initiate the analysis
									process.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>Image Processing:</strong> The tool
									performs image processing techniques to
									enhance the X-ray image and extract relevant
									features. This may involve adjusting
									contrast, resizing, or applying filters to
									improve the accuracy of the analysis.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> The
									tool analyzes the processed image to extract
									meaningful features that can help identify
									signs of pneumonia. This can include
									characteristics such as areas of opacity,
									consolidation, or infiltrates in the lung
									regions.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>Machine Learning Model:</strong> The
									tool employs a trained machine learning
									model specifically designed for pneumonia
									detection. The model has been trained on a
									large dataset of X-ray images, including
									both pneumonia-positive and
									pneumonia-negative cases.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>Prediction:</strong> The extracted
									features from the image are fed into the
									machine learning model, which makes a
									prediction regarding the presence of
									pneumonia. The model classifies the image as
									either "Pneumonia Detected" or "No Pneumonia
									Detected" based on the learned patterns and
									features.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>Result:</strong> The tool displays
									the prediction result to the user. If the
									model detects pneumonia in the uploaded
									X-ray image, it presents a message
									indicating that pneumonia is detected and
									recommends the user to consult a healthcare
									professional. If no pneumonia is detected,
									it displays a message stating that no
									pneumonia is detected, providing some relief
									to the user.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>Additional Information:</strong>
									Alongside the result, the tool can provide
									additional information such as the
									confidence score or probability of the
									prediction to indicate the model's level of
									certainty.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>Important Note:</strong> It's
									important to note that the accuracy and
									reliability of the tool heavily depend on
									the quality of the training data, the
									performance of the machine learning model,
									and the accuracy of the feature extraction
									techniques employed. Continuous refinement
									and evaluation of the model are necessary to
									ensure the tool's effectiveness in pneumonia
									detection. Additionally, the tool should
									always be used as a supportive tool and not
									a substitute for professional medical
									diagnosis.

					<h5>Extract CDS</h5>
					Input: The tool provides an input field where users can upload a Genbank file containing genetic sequence data. Users can either browse their local file system or drag and drop the Genbank file into the input field.

					Name the Result FASTA file: Users need to provide a name for the resulting FASTA file that will contain the extracted coding sequence (CDS) information. This can be done by typing a desired filename in a separate input field.
					
					Submit: Once the user has selected the Genbank file and provided a name for the output FASTA file, they click the "Submit" button to initiate the extraction process.
					
					Genbank Parsing: The tool parses the uploaded Genbank file to extract the necessary information related to the coding sequences (CDS). This includes identifying the location, start and end positions, and the DNA sequence of each CDS in the Genbank file.
					
					Extract CDS Sequences: Based on the parsed Genbank data, the tool extracts the coding sequences (CDS) from the genomic DNA sequence. It retrieves the DNA sequence of each CDS and prepares it for conversion to FASTA format.
					
					Convert to FASTA: The extracted CDS sequences are converted into FASTA format, which is a widely used standard for representing nucleotide or protein sequences. Each CDS is represented as a separate entry in the resulting FASTA file.
					
					Generate Result FASTA File: The tool generates a new FASTA file with the extracted CDS sequences. The filename provided by the user is used to save the file. The resulting FASTA file can be downloaded or accessed through a link on the tool's interface.
					
					Result: The tool displays a message indicating the successful completion of the extraction process. It informs the user that the CDS sequences have been extracted and saved in the specified FASTA file. Users can then use the resulting FASTA file for further analysis or downstream applications, such as sequence alignment or protein prediction.				</li>
